 ##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK Predictive analysis is a branch of data science that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast outcomes based on historical data. It enables businesses, researchers, and developers to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. In this project, we implement a predictive analysis pipeline using Python and several key libraries including pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

The primary aim is to train a machine learning model that can make accurate predictions and provide insights into the importance of each input feature, thus making the solution both predictive and interpretable.
